    <h1>Welcome to my CSS checkup!</h1>
    <p id="intro">
      This page will demonstrate my absolute control of basic css. It won't be vidible on the page,
      but if you look at main.css, you'll see that I edited the font-family and font-side properties.
      I also used the width property to set the widths of each container to 75% and used margin-left and 
      margin-right to center them on the page.  
    </p>

    <h2>Margin/Padding/Border</h2>
    <div class ="container" id="margin">
      <p>
        This box demonstrates the margin property. I applied the margin to this paragraph tag INSIDE the box.
        This creates a bigger gap between the border of the outer box and the border of the paragraph. As an added
        bonus, I also made the border of the paragraph dotted.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="container" id="padding">
      <p>
        This box demonstrates the padding property.  I changed the margin of the paragraph to zero. So, now
        the outer box border is in contact with the paragraph border, but notice that there's more space 
        between the text and the <strong>solid</strong> border of this paragraph beacuse I increased the padding.  
        Isn't it magical?
      </p>
    </div>
    <h2>Background</h2>
    <div class="container" id="pink-container">
      <p>
        This container demonstrates the background feature of CSS.  I thought the gradient effect
        in the example from the module was really cool, so I tried to put my own spin on it.
